This project contains initial work on an Android project that uses ImageJ.
___It is still experimental, and would benefit from additional polish and
reorganization. NOTHING HERE IS STABLE YET.___

Currently contains two components, `imagej-android` and `scijava-android` in
there, first rudimentary libraries for displaying an interactive command and
`RandomAccessibleInterval` + text views, testing the SciJava UI framework with
Android `RecyclerView`s... It's working, but it's not really a small example
at the moment.

Additional notes + images showing results will come later.
